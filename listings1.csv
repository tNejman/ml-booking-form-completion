While there is considerable road traffic in Eaux-Vives, this inconvenience is offset by the proximity of the lake and quays, ideal for enjoying a relaxing stroll. The presence of the large parks – Parc des Bastions, Parc des Eaux-Vives and Parc La Grange – as well as several welcoming places and numerous terraces, in particular around the Place du Bourg-de-Four, make the district an ideal place to meet up and make the most of your leisure time.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-634655109819595630/original/2ac532c2-ee47-4957-80ce-687e58be2b6d.png,25463887,https://www.nocarz.pl/users/show/25463887,,2015-01-01,"Geneva, Switzerland","",N/A,N/A,33%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1387e3b4-248e-437c-80a9-a5838ce909ef.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1387e3b4-248e-437c-80a9-a5838ce909ef.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,3,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Commune de Genève,,46.20017,,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,2,,1 bath,1,0,"[""Hair dryer"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Bathtub"", ""Freezer"", ""Washer"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Central heating"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Kitchen"", ""Private patio or balcony"", ""Essentials"", ""Baking sheet"", ""Elevator"", ""Shower gel"", ""65 inch HDTV"", ""Dining table"", ""Coffee"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Portable fans"", ""Bed linens"", ""Hangers"", ""Iron"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Mountain view"", ""Clothing storage: closet"", ""Fast wifi \u2013 553 Mbps"", ""City skyline view"", ""Oven"", ""Body soap"", ""Paid street parking off premises"", ""Host greets you"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Safe"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Dryer"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Hot water"", ""Cleaning available during stay"", ""Room-darkening shades""]",,,365,4,4,365,,4.0,365.0,,t,25,,,,2024-12-29,6,2,0,2022-06-13,2024-11-14,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.67,,f,1,1,0,0,0.19

  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
 If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too.
 If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
 Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

 If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
 If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster,
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
 If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
 Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

 If you can make a heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
 And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
 If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
 And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: ""Hold on!""

 If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
 If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
 If you can fill the unforgiving minute

Je suis français, je suis venu en Suisse pour 2 semaines de vacances et je ne suis jamais reparti depuis plus de 20 ans. J'ai vécu à Genève et aussi à Lausanne. Je suis infirmier de formation, puis je suis devenu cadre de soins. Je me suis ensuite réorienté pour diriger un restaurant à Genève.
Aujourd'hui je donne un nouveau souffle à ma carrière pour les années à venir.
J'aime: les langues étrangères, voyager, les films, la lecture, la cuisine, bien manger, passer des soirées entre amis, faire de nouvelles rencontres, la randonnée.
Je parle français , anglais, espagnol, je me débrouille en allemand et je comprends l'italien.
J'aime cuisiner, donc si vous venez au bon moment, j'ai peut-être un plat en préparation et vous aurez la chance de le partager avec nous.

Xuong:
Je suis vietnamien, je suis arrivé en Suisse en novembre 2012. J'apprends le français, pour le moment je ne travaille pas.
J'aime la cuisine vietnamienne, jouer au tennis sur PS3, le cinéma, la mer, rencontrer du monde, la campagne, sortir avec des amis, voyager.
Je parle vietnamien, anglais, mandarin, cantonais et je commence le français.

Nous avons toujours eu des invités d'un genre ou un autre occupant nos chambres d'amis. Nous aimons avoir des invités. Nous apprécions de passer du temps avec mais ils peuvent aussi mener leur petite vie dans leur coin, comme nous avons aussi parfois besoin de tranquillité.

Nous sommes heureux de pouvoir recevoir des gens des quatre coins du monde et de partager et échanger avec eux. Nous tenterons de leur faire découvrir la vie en Suisse et les bonnes combines que nous connaissons pour profiter au mieux de notre ville.

Jean-Philippe:
I am French, I came to Switzerland for 2 weeks vacation and I never left for nearly 20 years. I lived in Geneva and also in Lausanne. I am a nurse, and I became nurse manager. I then shifted to run a restaurant in Geneva.
Today I give a new life to my career for years to come.
Likes: foreign languages, traveling, movies, reading, cooking, eat well, spend evenings with friends, meet new people, hiking.
I speak French, English, Spanish, German I'm doing and I understand Italian.

I love to cook, so if you come at the right time, I may have been baking and you'll get to share with a cup of tea or coffee or vietnamese coffee.

Xuong:
I am Vietnamese, I arrived in Switzerland in November 2012. I'm learning French at the moment I'm not working.
I love Vietnamese food, play tennis on PS3, cinema, sea, meet people, the countryside, out with friends, traveling.
I speak Vietnamese, English, Mandarin, Cantonese and I started the French.

We've had guests of one kind or another occupying my spare rooms for most of life - I enjoy having guests, and love to entertain, but we can appreciate giving people their own quiet space as we also need our own privacy.
We are happy to hear from people around the world to share and exchange with them. We try to introduce them to life in Switzerland.

I live in Geneva Switzerland, the magnificient city with the big fontain, a lake for sailing, the alps for skiing, an excellent academical expertise (universities, EPFL, CERN, etc.) and all the most international organisations headquarters for a rich and continuous multicultural experience.

Thus I also love to welcome people from abroad to help them discovering our traditions and values.

Je suis français, je suis venu en Suisse pour 2 semaines de vacances et je ne suis jamais reparti depuis plus de 20 ans. J'ai vécu à Genève et aussi à Lausanne. Je suis infirmier de formation, puis je suis devenu cadre de soins. Je me suis ensuite réorienté pour diriger un restaurant à Genève.
Aujourd'hui je donne un nouveau souffle à ma carrière pour les années à venir.
J'aime: les langues étrangères, voyager, les films, la lecture, la cuisine, bien manger, passer des soirées entre amis, faire de nouvelles rencontres, la randonnée.
Je parle français , anglais, espagnol, je me débrouille en allemand et je comprends l'italien.
J'aime cuisiner, donc si vous venez au bon moment, j'ai peut-être un plat en préparation et vous aurez la chance de le partager avec nous.

Xuong:
Je suis vietnamien, je suis arrivé en Suisse en novembre 2012. J'apprends le français, pour le moment je ne travaille pas.
J'aime la cuisine vietnamienne, jouer au tennis sur PS3, le cinéma, la mer, rencontrer du monde, la campagne, sortir avec des amis, voyager.
Je parle vietnamien, anglais, mandarin, cantonais et je commence le français.

Nous avons toujours eu des invités d'un genre ou un autre occupant nos chambres d'amis. Nous aimons avoir des invités. Nous apprécions de passer du temps avec mais ils peuvent aussi mener leur petite vie dans leur coin, comme nous avons aussi parfois besoin de tranquillité.

Nous sommes heureux de pouvoir recevoir des gens des quatre coins du monde et de partager et échanger avec eux. Nous tenterons de leur faire découvrir la vie en Suisse et les bonnes combines que nous connaissons pour profiter au mieux de notre ville.

Jean-Philippe:
I am French, I came to Switzerland for 2 weeks vacation and I never left for nearly 20 years. I lived in Geneva and also in Lausanne. I am a nurse, and I became nurse manager. I then shifted to run a restaurant in Geneva.
Today I give a new life to my career for years to come.
Likes: foreign languages, traveling, movies, reading, cooking, eat well, spend evenings with friends, meet new people, hiking.
I speak French, English, Spanish, German I'm doing and I understand Italian.

I love to cook, so if you come at the right time, I may have been baking and you'll get to share with a cup of tea or coffee or vietnamese coffee.

Xuong:
I am Vietnamese, I arrived in Switzerland in November 2012. I'm learning French at the moment I'm not working.
I love Vietnamese food, play tennis on PS3, cinema, sea, meet people, the countryside, out with friends, traveling.
I speak Vietnamese, English, Mandarin, Cantonese and I started the French.

We've had guests of one kind or another occupying my spare rooms for most of life - I enjoy having guests, and love to entertain, but we can appreciate giving people their own quiet space as we also need our own privacy.
We are happy to hear from people around the world to share and exchange with them. We try to introduce them to life in Switzerland.

My name is Augustin. I’m a 31-year-old entrepreneur with a passion for hospitality and travel, always looking to create amazing guest experiences. I really enjoy the ability to share the experience of living in this great home. 

Definitely check with me for amazing sunset locations, where to go for superb walks, and where to have mindblowing culinary experiences! 

I have lived in Switzerland, Paris, Shanghai and Panama, and Medellin, Colombia for work and love to discover new cultures and landscapes myself.

Whether I’m cycling 5000km trails, climbing for 2 months in a fjord far away in Greenland, or freediving down to 35m deep, adventure and I are friends, to say the least!

I will always try to meet your expectations and even go beyond the expectation of your stay. If you have any suggestions for me, please let me know!

Some great features I have are due to the inspirations of other guests that stayed with me and had interesting ideas. So please don't hesitate to let me know your thoughts.
